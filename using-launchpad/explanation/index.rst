  -  Bug tracker 
   (Combine explanation from the following topics into a bug tracker topic and keep steps isolated in how-to guides.)

    - `Landing page for bug tracker <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/BugReportingTool.rst>`_ - explain bug tracker and its abilities but not steps to report a bug.
    
      - Also add https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/BugsYourProject.rst - Introduction to bug tracker

    - 

  - Launchpad answers
  (This could possibly go in the project and community section as well but needs to be very concise. If it is more detailed and presented as feature, let's retain it under Diataxis categories)

    - `Answers <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/Answers.rst>`_
    - `Answer tracker <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/AnswerTrackerDocumentation.rst>`_ - If possible, combine both answers and answer tracker
    - `Ask for help <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/AnswersAskingForHelp.rst>`_ - excluding the how to ask for help part
    - `Offer help <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/AnswersOfferingHelp.rst>`_ - excluding steps on how to offer
  
- Launchpad API

  - `launchpadlib <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/APIlaunchpadlib.rst>`_ - Some explanation of what's launchpadlib and the tutorial should link here.
  - `Lauchpad resources <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/APIHacking.rst>`_ - information about LP resources need to be separated out as explanation

- Working with code

  - `Launchpad CI <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/CodeContinuousIntegration.rst>`_ - Just the overview about LPCI
  - `Git Hosting <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/CodeGit.rst>`_ - The overview and supported versions can be condensed into an explanation. Ideally supported features will be a reference but we can keep it with the explanation until there is much more reference material to add.
  - `Code Imports <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/CodeImports.rst>`_
  - Merge proposal - Although this is common knowledge, there should be a topic explaining what an MP is and linked to the corresponding how-to guide on how to create an MP. Content of this file can be created from scratch or pulled in from the overview of the how-to guide
