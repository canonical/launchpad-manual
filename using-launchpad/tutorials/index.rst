The following are suggesting titles and topics for classification under tutorials:

(These suggestion are based on content already available that had the potential to be a tutorial. LP team members should evaluate the necessity and usefulness of these topics if they were tutorials)

- `Getting Started with Launchpad <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/APIlaunchpadlib.rst>`_

  - Also merge `New to launchpad <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/NewToLaunchpad.rst>`_
- `Getting started with Launchpad's email interface <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/BugsEmailInterface.rst>`_ - This is a suggestion, It can be split into multiple how-to guides as well.
- `Getting started with source package builds <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/PackagingSourceBuildsGettingStarted.rst>`_
  - Also merge `Reverting daily build <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/PackagingSourceBuildsGoingBack.rst>`_
