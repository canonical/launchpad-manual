=========
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1


The following are suggesting titles and topics for classification under reference:

- Launchpad API

  - `Using launchpadlib <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/APIExamples.rst>`_ - This can also be coverted to separate how-to guides or tutorials depending on how useful and important those examples are to the users
  - `Using applications based on launchpadlib <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/APIEndUserHints.rst>`_
  - `Programs that use LP API <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/APIUses.rst>`_
  - `Roles <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/BugSupervisors.rst>`_ - Assuming there are other roles and not just bug supervisors, having a common reference makes more sense.

- Bugs
(The different aspects of a bugs such as bug attachments, bug validity could be collated into a single topic if they can be more concise)

  - `Bug validity <https://github.com/canonical/help.launchpad.net-migration/blob/main/keep/BugExpiry.rst>`_
