   Asking for help <asking-for-help>
   Offering help <offering-help>

One key to making a free software project thrive is building a community
of dedicated users. An important aspect of this is making it easy for
users to get help in learning to use and master the product.

Mailing lists, web forums and IRC are great places to find help with
free software. Usually, you'll find someone who can answer your question
or, at the very least, point you in the direction of a useful web page.

These methods of finding and giving help have a couple of shortcomings,
though:

-  there's no way to track the progress of a question
-  knowledge about the software is spread across different places.

Launchpad Answers helps to solve these problems by:

-  tracking user questions in a similar way to bug reports
-  notifying volunteer support contacts of new questions
-  building a searchable knowledge base of good answers
-  allowing people to ask questions and offer support in different
   languages.

It also serves as a simple ticketing system for tracking admin requests.


Key Features
------------

**Launchpad Integration:** The Answer Tracker is available for all
hosted projects. You can also use the existing Team infrastructure to
organize the support community.

**Guided Filing:** When a user asks a new question, a search is done
through the existing questions to try to find similar ones. This helps
users get answers faster and reduces the number of similar questions in
the tracker.

**Multi-lingual Support:** Users can ask questions in their native
languages. People answering questions can choose which languages they
want to support. This feature makes it easy to build native-language
support community. Support as many languages as your users speak!

**Detailed Workflow:** The status of questions is tracked automatically
based on the actions people take on it. This makes it easy to track
which questions still need an answer and which need input from the user.

**Searchable Reports:** Various reports are offered making it easy to
find the questions you are interested in. The **Open** report is perfect
for users looking for a question still needing an answer. The
**Answered** report is great for users trying to find a solution to
their problem. There is also a **Need Attention** report which shows all
the questions that need your input. All these reports are searchable.

**Answer Contacts:** Dedicated users can register as answer contacts to
receive email notifications on all questions. These people are the
backbone of your user support community.

**Email Integration:** The answer tracker is very well integrated with
email. Users posting a question receive replies on it by email. Any
users can also subscribe to questions to receive notifications when new
messages are added to the question. It is even possible to post replies
to existing questions by email.

**Bug Links:** Questions can be linked to bug reports. This makes it
easy to build a two-layer bug reporting process where more knowledgeable
users can identify and file bugs from questions.


Launchpad Answers for your project
----------------------------------

If you're a project owner, you can use Launchpad Answers to provide
support to the users of your software and to build a knowledge base
about your software.

First, activate ``Answers`` for your project by selecting ``People can
ask questions in Launchpad Answers`` on the ``Change details``
page at ``https://launchpad.net//+edit``. Now, people can `ask for
help <Answers/AskingForHelp>`__ using Launchpad.

Next, encourage members of your community to use Answers. In particular,
you should consider encouraging members of your community to become
`answer contacts <Answers/OfferingHelp>`__.

The Launchpad Answer Tracker offers tools to effectively build a support
community around your project. It makes it easy for users to find help
by asking questions that can be answered by other users in the
community.
