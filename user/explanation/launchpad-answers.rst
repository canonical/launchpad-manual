Launchpad Answers

Using Launchpad to find help is easy. First off, visit the Answers page
for the project or distribution you're using.

**Example:** if you want help with the NULL project, you'd visit
https://answers.launchpad.net/null

Follow the \```Ask a question``\` link and choose the language with
which you're most comfortable.

{i} **Tip:** to improve your chances of getting an answer, choose a
language that is marked with an asterisk. These languages have support
volunteers whom Launchpad will notify of your question.

Next, type a summary the problem you're having. If you've ever reported
a bug using Launchpad, you'll find the following steps quite familiar.

Let's say you're having trouble getting Exaile to minimise to the system
notifications area of your Gnome panel (the systray). You enter the
question:

*:literal:`How``   ``do``   ``I``   ``minimise``   ``Exaile``   ``to``   ``the``   ``systray?`*

Launchpad will now search for existing questions that look similar. If
it finds any, it will show you them.

If Launchpad doesn't find any similar questions, or those it finds are
unhelpful to you, you can write a more detailed description of your
problem and submit your question.

What happens next?
------------------

Once you've added your question, Launchpad emails anyone who's
volunteered to be an answer contact for your language. They can then ask
you for more information or offer an answer. Launchpad will then email
you whenever your question changes, such as when someone suggests an
answer.

Based on your actions and theirs, Launchpad will change the question's
status, to help other people to see what action, if any, they should
take.

Question statuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each question can have one of six statuses:

-  **Open:** this question needs an answer, either because it is new or
   because a previous answer didn't completely solve the problem.
-  **Needs information**.
-  **Answered:** someone has answered the question but the original
   reporter hasn't yet said whether or not it solved their problem.
-  **Solved:** one of the answers to the question has solved the
   original reporter's problem.
-  **Expired:** Launchpad automatically expired this question because it
   stayed in the **Open** or **Needs information** state, without
   activity, for more than two weeks. Questions linked to bugs or
   assigned to a person cannot be expired.
-  **Invalid**. Only an answer contact may set this state

Actions that change a question's status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Someone, other than the reporter, has asked for more information**.
   When the question's status is \```Open```, this will change it to
   \```Needs information```.
-  **The reporter provides more information on the problem**. When the
   status of the question is \```Needs information```, this will change
   it back to \```Open```.
-  **Someone answers a question**. When the status of the question is
   \```Open``\` or \```Needs information```, this will change it to
   \```Answered```.
-  **The original reporter tells Launchpad they have found a solution**.
   The status moves to \```Solved```.
-  **The reporter confirms an answer given by another user**. The status
   moves to \```Solved```.
-  **After receiving an answer, the reporter replies that the problem
   still occurs**. This reverts status to \```Open```.
-  **Two weeks have passed without a change to the question**. If the
   question is in the \```Open``\` or \```Needs information``\` state,
   Launchpad's robot - the Launchpad Janitor - will automatically mark
   the question as \```Expired```.
-  **An answer contact or administrator rejects a question which
   contains spam or is a duplicate**. This changes the status to
   \```Invalid```.
