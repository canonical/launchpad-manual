Launchpad mailing lists
=======================

Launchpad allows a team to set up a discussion mailing list which is
open to all members of the team. For the technically minded, Launchpad
mailing lists are managed by `GNU Mailman <http://www.list.org>`__
although we have simplified the web interface, allowing you to more
easily administer your mailing lists. Using Launchpad alleviates the
need for external mail hosting and simplifies life for users and
administrators who can use a single Launchpad account to manage their
participation in multiple mailing lists.

Benefits
--------

Using Launchpad to host your mailing lists has several advantages over
self-hosted lists.

Simplified subscription management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of maintaining a separate password for every list your users participate
in, they can use their singleLaunchpad login to update their email address and
subscription preferences for any list.

Post from any email address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most email lists require you to use a specific email address when you post to that
list. Launchpad allows users to post messages to a mailing list from any email
address validated with Launchpad. Users can still specify exactly which validated
address will receive list messages.

Coordinated absence management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you do not wish to receive any email from ANY list for a period of time, you can tell
Launchpad to cease delivery of mail from all lists in which you
participate, for the period of time that you will be absent. Come
home to a clean inbox!

Simplified administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People who administer multiple lists multiple projects will find that Launchpad greatly
improves their ability to control list subscriptions. Launchpad's Mailman
implementation represents   best-practice with regard to mailing list set up, designed
by folks who run hundreds of lists. Use one Launchpad account to administer as many lists as
you need, across as many projects as you want.

Automatic archiving and distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Launchpad lists are automatically archived for history, in a format that is easily cataloged by
search engines. Copies are also archived on `The Mail Archive <http://www.mail-archive.com/>`__,
a popular long-term list archive site.

Sophisticated membership management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Teams already support many sophisticated ways of controlling membership - they can be tightly
controlled, entirely open, moderated, or invitation-only. Since teams govern
participation in Launchpad-hosted mailing lists, you can set up a list with
whichever governance model suits you best.

Natural fit to Launchpad teams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many projects use Launchpad teams to group their users and developers into convenient teams.
Those teams can be given different permissions in Launchpad, and now can also have mailing
lists associated with them.

Reduced spam and enhanced participation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List postings from email addresses not registered and validated to a Launchpad user are immediately
discarded, reducing the occurance of list spam.  Messages posted by validated
Launchpad users who are not subscribed to your mailing list are held for
your approval.  Once a person has proven themselves to be in good standing
e.g. by posting several on-topic messages to lists they are not members of,
this approval step is relaxed across all of Launchpad.

Using Launchpad hosted lists
----------------------------

Launchpad mailing lists are team-oriented; every team may have one
mailing list, and every mailing list is associated with exactly one
team. Any member of the team may subscribe to the team's mailing list
but team members are not required to participate on the mailing list.

When you join a list, you designate one of your Launchpad-validated
email addresses on which to receive mail from that list. You may post to
any mailing list from any of your validated email addresses, but you
will only receive messages from each list on the designated address for
that list. You may also ask Launchpad to use your *preferred email
address* and have mail from that list sent to your current preferred
email address, whatever that happens to be at the time.

.. note::
    
    All Launchpad mailing list messages are publicly archived, and **the
    archives are open to everyone**, not just Launchpad or team members.
    If you have any issues with information available in the archives,
    you should contact `the Launchpad
    administrators <http://help.launchpad.net/#head-9562b4c8ee3bbaca8f0d0719f973269f13539ced>`__,
    however our general policy is **never to remove archive messages or
    information contained therein.**

Subscribed team members may post their messages to
``myteam@lists.launchpad.net`` and the archives for the team mailing
list is always available at ``http://lists.launchpad.net/myteam``.

Establishing a mailing list
---------------------------

If you are a team administrator, look on your team overview page. You
will see an action called ``Configure mailing list``:


-  Click on this action and then click the ``Apply for Mailing List``
   button.

-  Your mailing list application now needs to be approved by the
   Launchpad administrators.  We handle new mailing list application requests several
   times per day, and we will enable your mailing list as soon as possible.

-  Once your mailing list is approved, go to your team's overview page
   and you should now see a link in the Summary section saying "Mailing list archive".
   While your archive will be empty until the first message is posted to your
   mailing list, once you see this link in the Summary section, you know that
   your mailing list is live.  You should also notice a new action that you can
   use to configure your mailing list.  ``

.. note::
  You can also set your Launchpad mailing list to be your team's contact address.

Subscribing to a mailing list
-----------------------------

Before you can send or receive messages on your mailing list, you should
subscribe to it. This includes the team owner who requested the mailing
list. Once your list is live (see above), these are the steps you need
to take to subscribe to the mailing list.

If you want to join the team at the same time you subscribe to its
mailing list, just go to the team's overview page and click on the *Join
this team* button. This will take you to the join page where you will be
presented with a checkbox for joining the team's mailing list at the
same time. Enable this, click *Join* and you will be both joined to the
team and subscribed to its mailing list.

(Note that the checkbox will either be enabled or disabled by default
depending on your *auto-subscription* setting. Go to your personal
*Change e-mail settings* page and click *Never subscribe to mailing
lists* to default this checkbox off (i.e. opt-in). Set this to *Ask me
when I join a team* to default this checkbox on (i.e. opt-out). If you
set this to *Always subscribe me to mailing lists* you will
automatically be subscribed to any team's mailing list when you join the
team. With this last setting, you will also be automatically subscribed
to a team's mailing list whenever anybody else joins you to a team
also.)

If you're already a member of the team, you can still join its mailing
list from the team's overview page, or you can manage all your team
mailing list subscriptions in one place:

-  Go to your

:literal:`personal list subscriptions page <https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+editemails>__`.

-  Toward the bottom of the page, you will see a list of all teams that
   you are a member of and that have a mailing list.

-  Use the drop-down menu to select which of your registered email
   addresses should be subscribed to which mailing list, and then click :literal:`Update Subscriptions`.

-  Within a minute or two you should be a member of the mailing list and
   you should be able to post to the list.

Using your mailing list
-----------------------

Using your mailing list is the easiest part of this process! If your
team is named *myteam*, then once the list is live and you have
subscribed to it, just send a message to \`myteam@lists.launchpad.net\`
in your mail reader of choice. After a few minutes, depending on network
latencies, you should receive your message in your inbox, and the
message will appear in the archive.

.. note::
    
    If you use Gmail and you do not see your own posts arrive in
your inbox, it is probably because of `this
issue <http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/faqw-mm.py?req=show&file=faq02.008.htp>`__.
Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it, but if you check your
list's archive, your message should appear there.

Unsubscribing
-------------

Unsubscribing is easy. Just visit your `Launchpad mailing list
subscriptions <https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+editemails>`__ page,
scroll down to the list of teams you're subscribed to, and chose ``Don't
Subscribe`` for any list you want to get off of. Click ``Update
Subscriptions``.

Posting to lists without subscribing
------------------------------------

If you want to make a one-off post to a list, you don't have to
subscribe. Instead, you can post to it using any email address
registered in your Launchpad profile.

Your post will be held for moderation and it is up to the relevant
team's administrators to decide whether or not to accept your post.

Moderating posts from non-subscribers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From time to time, you may find that people post to your mailing list
without first subscribing.

So long as the posts are from registered Launchpad users, Launchpad
holds the posts for you - as a team administrator - to moderate. When
there are new posts to moderate, you can see them by following the link
in the ``Actions`` menu on your team's overview page.
