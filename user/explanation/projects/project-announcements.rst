Publishing project announcements
================================

`Terminator <https://launchpad.net/terminator>`__ is a project dedicated
to concurrently displaying multiple terminal sessions as efficiently as
possible. Like most projects, Terminator tells the world about its
progress through regular announcements.

Using Launchpad, Terminator can publish their announcements in several
places:

-  on the project's overview page
-  on a dedicated `announcement page for
   Terminator <https://launchpad.net/terminator/+announcements>`__
-  on a `Launchpad-wide announcements
   page <https://launchpad.net/+announcements>`__
-  in Atom feeds both for `Terminator's
   announcements <http://feeds.launchpad.net/terminator/announcements.atom>`__
   and `all Launchpad project
   announcements <http://feeds.launchpad.net/announcements.atom>`__.


In effect, Launchpad provides Terminator with a lightweight blog; the
most obvious difference being that Launchpad doesn't offer readers the
opportunity to leave comments. However, if the Terminator community had
a full blog, hosted elsewhere, they could link each announcement they
make on Launchpad to the releated blog post.

This helps make Terminator's Launchpad project overview page into a
reference for all information about the project.

Making announcements
--------------------

You don't need to do anything special to activate announcements,
although you do need to be the project's owner (or member of the owning
team) to post. You have the choice of publishing immediately, saving
your post as a draft or setting it to publish at a future time and date.

Further information
-------------------

Now that you've registered your project, you can pick and choose which
parts of Launchpad you want to use. Let's take a look at the `bug
tracker <Bugs/YourProject>`__.
