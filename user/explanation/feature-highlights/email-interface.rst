Launchpad's email interface
===========================

Launchpad's bug tracker sends you `email <Bugs/Subscriptions>`__ about
the bugs you're interested in. If you see something that requires your
attention - for example, you want to comment on a bug - rather than
leaving your email client to fire up a web browser, all you need to do
is reply to the email.

It's not just limited to replying to bug notifications, though. The bug
tracker's email interface allows you to do just about everything you can
in the web interface. Within time, you may find that email is the main
way you interact with the bug tracker.

Anatomy of an email to the bug tracker
--------------------------------------

Let's look at the elements of a bug report email:

-  **From address:** the address from which you send the email must be
   `registered in your Launchpad
   account <https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+editemails>`__.
-  **To address:** new@bugs.launchpad.net for new bugs;
   \```bugnumber@bugs.launchpad.net``\` to manipulate an existing bug
   report; \```edit@bugs.launchpad.net``\` for bulk edits.
-  **Subject:** Launchpad uses this as the bug report or comment
   summary.
-  **Email body:** the text of your email forms the bug report or
   comment detail. This is also where you can supply commands to
   manipulate the bug.

That last item, the email body, needs a little more explanation. When
you want to use one of the email interface's commands, **you need to
start the line with a space**. Otherwise, Launchpad will treat your
command as a comment only and not as a command.

.. note::
    All commands are also posted as a comment to the bug. This is something we plan to fix.
