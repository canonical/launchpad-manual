Your Launchpad account
======================

Before you start using Launchpad, you need to `set up a Launchpad
account <YourAccount/NewAccount>`__. With your new Launchpad account,
you'll be able to:

-  show other people what work you do in Launchpad and earn karma
-  join teams working on free software
-  file, comment on, triage and solve bugs
-  host and monitor code in Bazaar branches or CVS and Subversion
   repositories
-  help translate software
-  contribute ideas and specifications to free software projects, then
   track their progress
-  ask for and offer help with free software
-  build and host Ubuntu packages
-  register your own project and make its binaries available for
   download.

Of course, you can pick and choose which parts of Launchpad interest
you.

Managing your account
---------------------

Here are some of the things you might want to do when you first join
Launchpad:

-  `Create and personalise your account <YourAccount/NewAccount>`__
-  `Import an OpenPGP key <YourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey>`__
-  `Import your SSH keys <YourAccount/CreatingAnSSHKeyPair>`__
-  `Learn about Launchpad karma <YourAccount/Karma>`__
-  `Log into other websites using OpenID through
   Launchpad <YourAccount/OpenID>`__
-  `Contacting people and teams in
   Launchpad <YourAccount/ContactingPeople>`__

If you have more than one account, you may want to `merge two or more
accounts <YourAccount/Merging>`__.

And we'd hate to see you leave but, if you need to, you can also `close
your account <YourAccount/Closing>`__.
