Glossary
========

- **Bugtask:** A bug tracked in Launchpad can appear
in different projects and releases of a project, enabling different
teams to work together on solving that bug. We call each appearance of a
bug in each different context a bugtask. A bugtask has associated with
it an assignee, an importance and a status. It can be targeted to a
project or distribution milestone.

- **Component:** Distribution package archives can
have arbitrary groupings, which are called components. Ubuntu uses
components to bring together packages of a certain licensing type or
that have a certain level of support commitment: e.g. main, universe and
multiverse.

- **Display name:** Projects, teams and
individuals in Launchpad are usually referred to by their display name.
This is distinct from the ``Name``, which is mostly used in URLs.
Example: Mark Shuttleworth's display name is ``Mark Shuttleworth``,
whereas his Launchpad name is ``sabdfl``.

- **FTBFS:** a source package failed to build.

- **Karma:** Karma is a score that gives a rough idea of
a person's current level of work in Launchpad. See our guide to
`karma <YourAccount/Karma>`__ for more.

- **Pocket:** A release pocket is group of packages
related to a particular distro series (i.e. a release such as Ubuntu
9.04/Jaunty), such as *security*, *updates* or *back-ports*/

- **Name (project):** This is the unique short
name that Launchpad uses to identify a project. It is used in URLs and
when registering a bug against a project. **Example:** ``blueprint``
in https://launchpad.net/blueprint for Launchpad's Blueprint Tracker.

- **Project group:** Project groups allow you to
gather several Launchpad projects together. Each project within a group
inherits the group's preferences regarding bug tracking, translation and
security policy. An example project group is Mozilla, with Firefox and
Thunderbird as projects within the group.

- **Series:** Series are major lines of development
that usually result in one or more releases. For example: Firefox 3 and
Firefox 2. In Launchpad, they can have independent translations, bug
reports, code and more. In a distribution, such as Ubuntu, it would be
releases such as Jaunty, Intrepid, Hardy and so on.

- **Suite:** The combination of a distro
`series <#series>`__ and a `pocket <#pocket>`__ is called a suite: e.g.
Hardy backports.
