Project Announcements
=====================

Launchpad publishes news feeds for your project. You can make
announcements through Launchpad, and the 5 most recent headlines will be
displayed on your project home page. Each project now also has a feed
URL where an Atom 1.0 feed of news and announcements is published.

Each announcement can include a headline, summary paragraph, and an
optional URL which links to the full announcement on the web.

Making an announcement
----------------------

If you are the person who registered the project in Launchpad, you can
make an announcement on behalf of that project. Go to your project home
page and find the link to "Make an announcement". This presents you with
a form for the announcement details. You can choose to publish the
announcement immediately, or keep it confidential until a specific date.
Alternatively, you can just leave it unpublished until you are ready to
come back and publish it.

Editing announcements
---------------------

If you are a project administrator you can edit the announcements at any
time. This includes the ability to retract an announcement, which takes
it out of the RSS feeds and off the project home page. If you want, you
can delete an announcement entirely. You can also move an announcement
from one project to another as long as you are and administrator of both
projects.

RSS feeds
---------

You will notice that your project home page includes a link to an Atom
feed. Most browsers will show the standard feed icon in the URL toolbar.
Clicking on that link will allow you to subscribe to the news feed for
this project using your favourite RSS reader.
