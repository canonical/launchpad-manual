Translation guidelines
======================

In Launchpad, each administrator of a localization team can inform
Launchpad about the team's guidelines.

As a result translators working at projects assigned to the team, will
see a big banner informing them about the guidelines.

All new translators have good intentions and they want to submit
translations of good quality, but they lack experience and domain
knowledge about software translations. The existence of translation
guidelines should help new translators to achive good quality even when
doing their first suggestions.

To help you with creating the guidelines for your team you may consult
the `general Launchpad Guidelines <Translations/Guide>`__.

Let Launchpad know about your guidelines
----------------------------------------

In order to inform Launchpad about the guidelines for your team, all you
have to do is to consult `your translations personal
page <https://translations.launchpad.net/people/+me>`__.

Click the edit icon next to each translation team and put the link to
your guidelines.

owner <Translations/YourProject>`__. That way, you can learn more about
the different permissions structures for translations.
