Choosing a permissions policy
=============================

When opening your project for translation in Launchpad, you need to
decide how you want to balance openness with quality control.

Launchpad allows you to choose who can submit suggestions, directly
enter translations and review translations for your project. All you
need to do is select one of Launchpad's four translations permission
policies:

-  **Open:** anyone can submit translations directly to your project in
   Launchpad. Great for encouraging drive-by contributions.
-  **Structured:** if your project's translation group has assigned an
   individual or team to a particular language, only that person or
   members of that team can review and accept translation strings for
   that language. Anyone can suggest a translation for those languages,
   though. For languages that don't have an appointed team/individual
   within your translation group, anyone can directly submit a
   translation.
-  **Restricted:** similar to \``structured``, except that translations
   are closed on languages that don't have an individual or team
   assigned to it within the translation group.
-  **Closed:** only people or teams appointed in the translation group
   can suggest or make translations. Translation is closed to everyone
   else. This is ideal if your project requires an agreement to transfer
   copyright before starting work.

Set your project's permissions policy by following the *Change
permissions* link under the *Permissions* section on your project's
translations overview page.

Now that you've decided your review policy, you need to `choose a
translation group <Translations/YourProject/ChoosingAGroup>`__.
