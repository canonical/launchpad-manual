Launchpad translators group
===========================

The `Launchpad Translators
group <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators/>`__
is a set of teams and individuals working on translating software hosted
in Launchpad. It is a confederation of translation teams, it is not yet
another translation project.

We believe that people translating software in the same language should
work in the same team, even thought they are working at different
software.

There is one Launchpad localization team appointed for each language.

We encourage Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, GNOME, KDE, Mozilla,
!OpenOffice.org and all other translators dedicated to a specific
project to join the localization team appointed for their language.

We also encourage project maintainers to appoint the **Launchpad
Translators** group as the translation group for their project.

Project maintainers
-------------------

Every project needs high quality translation that convey with the
cultural background and the already established guidelines of each
language.

The **Launchpad Translators** group stands for those goals. Here you can
find a list of steps to follow in order to use Launchpad Translations as
the translation tool for you project and have it translated into many
languages.

-  Before proceeding, please take a moment and see how you can use
   Launchpad and what you should do in order to have your project
   translated. You can find these information at `Translating your
   project help
   pages <https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/YourProject>`__.

   Translators" group for doing the translation. Follow this link to
   find more info about `Choosing permissions
   policy <https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/YourProject/PermissionPolicies>`__.
   We recommend using the *Structured* policy, as a measure to assure
   translation quality.

   string changes, string freeze... etc.) or a `specific language
   team <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators/>`__
   for things affecting only one language.

Launchpad localization teams
----------------------------

Launchpad localization teams are the driving force behind the Launchpad
translation process. Each localization team will translate and check
translations on behalf of the language appointed to it.

Launchpad Translators Group will only have one team appointed to each
language.

To check the current status of Launchpad Translators Group, please
consult the `list of Launchpad localization
teams <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators/>`__:

-  If your language does not appear in the list, please consider
   starting a new team for your language.
-  If your language is in the list, please consider joining that team
   (or request that your current team to be added as a subteam).

If the Launchpad localization team appointed to your language is no
longer active, or in case you encounter problems joining or working with
the team, please let us know by `contacting the Launchpad Translation
Coordinators <https://launchpad.net/%7Elaunchpad-translators-leaders/+contactuser>`__.

How to start a new team and join Launchpad Translators
------------------------------------------------------

Here's how you can create a new team for your language and join the
Launchpad Translators group:

-  **Create the team**. `Create a new Launchpad localization
   team <https://launchpad.net/people/+newteam>`__. When giving a name
   to the team in Launchpad, please follow the convention
   **lp-l10n-CC**, where CC is your **language** code . We use iso-639
   two letters code and if not available we fallback to three letters
   code. For instance **lp-l10n-de** would be the name for the German
   team (language code *de*)
-  **Moderated subscription**. Make the `subscription
   policy <Teams/CreatingAndRunning#Subscription%20policies>`__ of the
   new team **Moderated** or **Restricted**. Only this way you can
   ensure the quality of translations.
-  **Team information**. Add some brief information on the team's page.
   This should include:

   -  A welcome note with the purpose of the team
   -  A note on how to join the team
   -  Links to the team's existing communication channels (e.g. mailing
      list, forums, IRC channel, wiki, etc)

-  **Team communication**. The team should have a communication channel
   to coordinate the translation activities. This can be any of: a
   mailing list, IRC, forums, etc. This can be arranged after the team
   has been accepted, but it is a requirement.
-  **Guidelines**. The team should have a set of translation guidelines.
   This can be arranged after the team has been accepted, but it is a
   requirement.

   -  You can use the `general Launchpad localization
      guidelines <Translations/Guide>`__ or adapt them for your
      language/team.
   -  `Let Launchpad know about your translation
      guidelines <Translations/Guidelines>`__.

-  **Coordinator**. The team should have a coordinator with a stable
   contact e-mail address visible to logged-in Launchpad users. The
   coordinator should subscribe to the launchpad-translators mailing
   list and forward any relevant announcements or information to the
   team. As the coordinator, you are the primary contact person for the
   team and the person who make things happen.

   -  

      -  As the coordinator of a Launchpad localization team, it is
         higly recommended to join the `Launchpad Translators mailing
         list <https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-translators>`__.

-  **Apply**. `Send a support
   request <https://answers.launchpad.net/rosetta/+addquestion>`__ for
   the Launchpad Translations Coordinators to appoint your team in the
   Launchpad Translators group. Please include a link to your team and a
   short note explaining how you have addressed the points above.

Except for creating the guidelines and setting up a communication
channel, this process should not take more than a few minutes to
complete. If you need any help or you've got any questions in any of the
steps, feel free to
`ask <https://answers.launchpad.net/rosetta/+addquestion>`__, and we'll
be happy to give a hand.
