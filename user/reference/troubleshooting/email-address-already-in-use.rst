If you to register an account using an email address that Launchpad
already knows about, Launchpad will give you an error message.

There are a few reasons why your email address might already be in
Launchpad, including:

-  you already have a Launchpad account using that email address
-  something went wrong on Launchpad's side.

Here's what you should do.

You already have an account with that address
---------------------------------------------

If you don't remember the password for the account that uses that email
address, you can request a reminder on the standard `Launchpad login page <https://launchpad.net/+login>`_.

If you also no longer have access to the email address, you should
create a new Launchpad account and then follow our :ref:`instructions on merging accounts <merging-accounts>`.
