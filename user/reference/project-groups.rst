Project Groups
==============

Project groups allow an organisation to manage several projects from a
single place.

Managing projects with a project group
--------------------------------------

The Project group driver is also a driver for all the associated
projects. The project group drivers can manage bugs and blueprints in
the associated projects, including setting priority, status, and
targeting them to milestones.

A project group milestone allows you to view all the targeted bugs and
blueprints from all the associated projects on a single page. You can
see who is working the issues and their state. The project group
milestones are virtual; they are derived from the names of the
milestones in the associates projects.

Requesting a project group
--------------------------

You can `request a project
group <https://launchpad.net/launchpad/+addquestion>`__ by asking a
question at the Launchpad project. Explain why you need a project group,
listing the projects that will be in the group. The request should
include:

-  

   -  The name of the project group.
   -  The desired Launchpad ID (http://launchpad.net/).
   -  A one sentence summary of the project.
   -  A paragraph description of the project.
   -  The team that will own the project.
