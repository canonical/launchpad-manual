Consumer hosting
================

Projects with prior approval from Canonical can use additional privacy
features. Proprietary projects may only use Launchpad with such
approval. Details are found on the project's "Sharing" page.

Projects with commercial support can configure the bug and branch
sharing policies:

-  Public <
   > Branches or bugs are public unless they contain sensitive
   information.
-  Public, can be proprietary <
   > New branches or bugs are public, but can be made proprietary later.
-  Proprietary, can be public <
   > New branches or bugs are proprietary, but can be made public later.
   Only people who can see the project's proprietary information can
   create new branches or bugs.
-  Proprietary <
   > Branches or bugs are always proprietary. Only people who can see
   the project's proprietary information can create new branches.

We recommend that projects share all information types with their
developer teams. Sharing with your organisation team will also ensure
your co-workers are informed and can do their job. Avoid sharing with
users because they leave projects and organisations; if a user needs
access to confidential information either add the user a team that is
already shared with or subscribe the user to just the bugs and branches
then need to work with.

As the maintainer of a project with commercial support, you can create:

-  Private teams <
   > Visible to team members only
-  Private mailing lists <
   > Visible to team members only
-  Private package archives <
   > Visible to team members and to users you offer a package
   subscription too

Canonical `formerly sold commercial
subscriptions <https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+faq/208>`__
which allowed the use of commercial-only features. This scheme is no
longer in operation, although use of commercial-only features may still
be granted on a case-by-case basis.
