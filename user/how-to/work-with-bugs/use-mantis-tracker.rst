Track bugs with Mantis
======================

If you want to use Launchpad to monitor the status of bugs in a Mantis
bug tracker, you need to let Launchpad know where the bug tracker is
hosted.

Register a Mantis bug tracker
------------------------------

1. 

   1. Visit https://launchpad.net/bugs/bugtrackers

.. raw:: html

   <!-- end list -->

1. 

   1. Follow the ``Register bug tracker`` link.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- end list -->

1. 

   1. Enter a name for the bug tracker. The name you choose should use
      alphanumeric characters and hyphens only so that it can form part
      of a URL. For example: if the project is called ``Jeff's Text
      Editor``, you might enter the name ``jeffs-text-editor``.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- end list -->

1. 

   1. Select ``Mantis`` from the ``Bug Tracker Type`` drop-down list.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- end list -->

1. 

   1. Use the ``Title`` text-box to enter a descriptive, human-readable
      name for the bug tracker. In our example from step 2, you could
      use ``Jeff's Text Editor Mantis Tracker`` here.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- end list -->

1. 

   1. Enter a summary of the bug tracker's purpose and the sort of bugs
      that it tracks.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- end list -->

1. 

   1. Enter the base URL of your bug tracker. For example:
      ``https://www.example.com/jeffs-mantis``

.. raw:: html

   <!-- end list -->

1. 

   1. Describe how people can contact you.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- end list -->

1. 

   1. When you are ready, click the ``Add`` button to register your bug
      tracker with Launchpad.

Watch Mantis bugs
-----------------

Once your bug tracker is registered, you can link to it from Launchpad
bugs as usual. Read more about bug watch links at
FeatureHighlights/BugWatches.

Translate Mantis bug statuses
-----------------------------

Launchpad translates the statuses used by external bug trackers to the
equivalent Launchpad bug status. This makes it easier for Launchpad
users to understand the status of a bug, whether or not it is tracked
directly in Launchpad. Look at BugStatuses for information on how
Launchpad translates Mantis bug statuses.
