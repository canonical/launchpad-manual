Managing bugs through email
===========================

If you prefer, you can entirely manage bugs using email.

Using the email interface you can:

-  file a new bug
-  comment on an existing bug
-  assign a bug to someone
-  change the status of a bug
-  record that a bug affects a different community.

Get email notification of new bugs in a project or package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can ask Launchpad to email you every time someone reports a bug
against a project or package that interests you, by registering as a bug
contact for that project or package.

By replying to the new bug notification email, you can assign the bug to
a Launchpad user or change its status, or just comment on the bug. For
the details of how to use the email interface, please read our guide to
UsingMaloneEmail.

Subscribe to specific bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are particularly interested in a specific bug, you can subscribe
to it. Launchpad will email you every time someone comments on the bug
or changes its status. If you reply to any of these emails, your
comments will be sent to all of the other bug subscribers, and presented
on the web site too. This is the best way to keep up to date with the
progress of a bug.

Of course email notifications also work with remote bug watches. When
you create a bug watch linking the Launchpad bug to a report in another
community's bug tracker, Launchpad will notify all subscribers when
there is a change to the remote bug's status. This is an excellent way
to keep track of the big picture of community work on a bug.

Use teams to track bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, a group of people may want to receive email notifications for
a set of packages, or projects. With Launchpad, you can create a team
and either subscribe that team to the bug or make the team a bug
contact.

Launchpad will email everyone in that team every time a new bug is filed
against the project or package.

tour, `Understanding Launchpad
teams <FeatureHighlights/TeamManagement>`__.
