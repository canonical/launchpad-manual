### Project information
############################################################

# Product name
project = "Launchpad Manual"
author = "Canonical Group Ltd"

# Uncomment if your product uses release numbers
# release = '1.0'

# The default value uses the current year as the copyright year.
#
# For static works, it is common to provide the year of first publication.
# Another option is to give the first year and the current year
# for documentation that is often changed, e.g. 2022â€“2023 (note the en-dash).
#
# A way to check a GitHub repo's creation date is to obtain a classic GitHub
# token with 'repo' permissions here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Next, use 'curl' and 'jq' to extract the date from the GitHub API's output:
#
# curl -H 'Authorization: token <TOKEN>' \
#   -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' \
#   https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/<REPO> | jq '.created_at'
