Depending on how you want to use Launchpad, you'll need to give us some
information.

At the very least, you need to create a user account.

- `Create your user account <https://launchpad.net/+login>`__.
  `Need help with this? <YourAccount/NewAccount>`__
- `Register your project <https://launchpad.net/projects/+new>`__: use one or
  all of Launchpad's tools, or just tell the world more about your
  project. `Need help with this? <Projects/Registering>`_
- `Create a team in Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/people/+newteam>`__: work with
  other people in your community, take shared responsibilities and run
  a mailing list. `Need help with this? <Teams/CreatingAndRunning>`__
