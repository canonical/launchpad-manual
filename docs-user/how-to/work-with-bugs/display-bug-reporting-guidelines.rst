If your project has guidelines to ensure a certain format or type of bug
report, you can ask Launchpad to display them to people that report bugs
against your project.

Specifying your bug reporting guidelines
----------------------------------------

**Step 1**: If you are a project owner, visit your project's overview
page and click ``Change details`` in the ``Actions`` menu.

**Step 2**: Paste a description of what your project considers to be a
good bug report into the ``Bug reporting guidelines`` text-box. This
can include URL links to further information.

**Step 3**: Save the changes.

Launchpad will now show bug reporters your guidelines at various points
during the bug reporting process, including at the start.
