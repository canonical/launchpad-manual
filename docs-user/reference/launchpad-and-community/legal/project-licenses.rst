Licenses
========

This page divides the licenses that have been reviewed by the Launchpad
staff into open and proprietary groups. Licenses that comply with
`Legal#Project_eligibility <Legal#Project_eligibility>`__ are considered
to be open, and the projects that use them are free to use Launchpad.
Licenses that do not comply are considered to be proprietary. Projects
with proprietary licenses can `seek approval from
Canonical <CommercialHosting>`__ or change to an open license.

Open
----

OSI-approved/FSF-approved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Licenses already approved as free-software / open-source licenses by
the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative are
automatically open enough for Launchpad. Any license on one list is
usually on the other. If a project wants to use a license approved by
one organization but not the other, we'll consider it on a
case-by-case basis (but it's incredibly rare that that would come up).
