Closing your project
====================

If you own a project in Launchpad and either no longer need it or don't
have time to run it, you could consider:

-  finding someone else who wants to run it and handing control to them
-  leaving the project in Launchpad as a historical record.

However, if the project has remained inactive and you're certain that
you no longer want it in Launchpad, please `file a project closure
request in Launchpad

.. note::
    If there is a significant amount of work associated with a
    project, particular from people other than yourself, we may ask you to
    consider options other than closing the project.
