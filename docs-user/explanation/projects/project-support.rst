Providing support throughLaunchpad
==================================

Helping other users is a great way to make a contribution to free
software projects. To this end, Launchpad offers tools to assist in the
creation of a user support community around hosted projects.

Can I help?
-----------

Anyone can help answer questions; it requires only as much technical
knowledge as a user has.

You will want to help with a project you know well. But you don't have
to be an expert to give help: any patient person that regularly uses a
particular application can usually provide good help to a new user. So
don't hesitate to join the support community of your favorite
applications.

Finding questions to answer
---------------------------

The first step is to find somebody needing help. The best place to look
is in the Answer Tracker of the project you want to help with. You can
access the Tracker from any page related to that project by clicking on
the ``Answers`` tab.

The Answer Tracker main page displays all the active questions for that
particular project. This includes not only questions waiting for an
answer, but also questions that were already answered or that needs more
information from the submitter.

To obtain a listing containing only the questions which needs an answer,
click on the ``Open`` link in the side action menu. You can then browse
that list to find a question to answer.

.. tip::
    When you leave the mouse over a question title, a small note
    will pop-up containing the beginning of the question content. That way
    you don't have to click on every questions to get its content.

.. tip::
    If you are more familiar with some aspect of an application,
    you can enter some search keywords in the search box to restrict the
    listing to questions containing these keywords. If you are looking for
    questions in Ubuntu related to the Konqueror web browser, for instance,
    you could enter ``konqueror`` as a search term.

Replying to a question
----------------------

Once you found a quesiton on which you want to provide help, click on it
to access the question page. There are two kinds of replies you can do
on a question.

1. First, if it is not clear from the description what the problem is,
   or if it doesn't contain enough context to allow you to diagnose, you
   should ask the submitter for more information. Enter your questions
   in the message box at the bottom of the screen and click on the ``Add
   Information Request``. The person who asked the quesiton will receive
   a notification with your request for more information.

   <!-- end list -->

1. Sometimes you just know from the start how the user's problem could
   be solved. When this happens, you just enter the answer in the
   message box and click the ``Add Answer`` button. The user will receive
   an email notification with your answer. The question status will be
   changed to ``Answered`` letting others know that this question already
   has an answer.

In any event, you have the option of subscribing to the question when
replying to it; it is highly recommended you do in order to allow you to
track follow-ups.

Handling follow-up
------------------

Once you added either an answer or an information request, it is the
turn of the user who submitted the question to give feedback. He will do
that either by providing the information you requested, by confirming
your answer, or by informing of new developments in the problem.

To receive the user's reply by email, you need to be subscribed to the
question, and the easiest way to do this is subscribing as you reply.
You can also subscribe yourself by clicking ``Subscribe`` link in the
action menu.

If you choose not to subscribe to the question, you can still see that
feedback was provided by looking at the ``Needs Attention`` report. To
access that report, go to your Launchpad home page and click on the
'Answers' tab . You will find the link to the ``Needs Attention`` report
in the action menu.

``This report lists all the questions on which you provided an answer
or a request for more information that received a reply.
To read the reply, you will need to visit the question's page.``

Registering as an answer contact
--------------------------------

If you know a project well enough, and would like to help its users
regularly, you might consider registering as answer contact. When you
register as answer contact, you receive an email notification for every
new question submitted on the project you registered for. You will also
receive notifications for every change made on the questions. In
addition, you will be allowed to reject invalid questions (questions
that are spam, duplicate, or not really related to the project.)

To register as answer contact, first go to the prokect that you want to
be an answer contact of. Click on the ``Answers`` tab. You then access the
answer contact registration page by following the ``Set answer contact``
link in the action menu. On that page you can register yourself (or any
of the teams you are a member of) as an answer contact for that project.

.. tip::
    Being an answer contact for a distribution as big as Ubuntu
    usually involves receiving a lot of mail. You may also register as
    answer contact only for one of the distribution's packages. You will
    then only receive questions notifications for those related to that
    application. For example, you could choose to only receive questions
    related to Firefox by registering as an answer contact on the page for
    the ``firefox`` package in Ubuntu.

If you ever find you don't have time or interest in being an answer
contact any longer, you can visit the same page again to remove yourself
from the answer contact list. You can also use the ``Answer contact for``
report available under the ``Answers`` tab of your home page. It lists all
the projects for which you (or one of your team) registered as an answer
contact. It also provides a quick link to the page where you can remove
that registration.

Linking to bugs
---------------

It sometimes happens that the source of the problem described in a
question is related to or caused by a bug in the software. When this
happens, it is a good idea to link the question to the bug report, so
that developers can know that this question is related to it. It also
provides additional information to the user filing the question; he can
keep an eye on the bug and see when its status changes. (Subscribers to
the question will receive a notification whenever the linked bug status
changes.)

If an existing bug report is related to the question, you can record the
link by using the ``Link existing bug`` link in the action menu on the
related question. You simply enter the bug report number and click
'Link' to record the link.

If there is no existing bug report, you can create a new bug at the same
time as recording the link by using the ``Create bug report`` link in the
action menu on the related question. You will then have to enter a
summary of the bug report. The summary should describe the the software
defect in some details. The bug report description defaults to the
question's description, but it is a good idea to edit it to summarize
the problem better. You then click on the ``Create Bug Report`` button to
finish the process. The created bug report will be linked to the
original question.
