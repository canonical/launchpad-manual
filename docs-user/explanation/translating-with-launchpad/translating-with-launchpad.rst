Using Launchpad, you can translate free software projects and distribution packages into your own language.
All you need are `your Launchpad account <https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount>`_ and a web browser.
There's no special software and in most cases you don't need to join a team to get started.

.. tip::
    If you haven't already, `tell Launchpad which languages you want to work with <https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+editlanguages>`_.
    Once you've done that, Launchpad will only show you the languages you're interested in.
