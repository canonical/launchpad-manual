Build farm
==========

Short description
-----------------
Builds and tests software for Ubuntu and related systems.

Detailed description
--------------------
The build farm builds packages, such as debs, snaps, charms, and other
formats for Ubuntu in a secure and isolated way.

The build farm consists of a manager, a proxy for outbound communication,
and various builder regions.
Build jobs are created by other parts of Launchpad, such as a change to a
git repository resulting in snap recipe builds.
They are then scheduled onto builders as virtual machines by
``buildd-manager``.

``buildd-manager`` continuously monitors all builders in the farm, and when
a builder is idle it chooses the next highest priority job for dispatch to
the idle builder.
It does this by using XML-RPC, passing relevant data to the builder, which
in turn fetches all ingredients for executing the build.
When a build has completed, ``buildd-manager`` gathers the resulting files
and injects them into Launchpad via an upload queue processor, and then the
builder is reset to a baseline state.

The manner in which a build is executed is determined by the build type.
This typically involves invoking some external tools; ``sbuild`` for Ubuntu
package builds, ``snapcraft`` for snap builds, etc.

Builders do not have direct access to the internet, but rather need to
acquire an authentication token to be able to access a restricted set of
URLs on the internet via a squid proxy.

Builder regions are physically co-located and consist of machines of the
same architecture family.
Builder regions comprise per-architecture image builders, and each physical
location contains a ``launchpad-vbuilder-manage`` instance which handles
resets for all architectures within that location.

Each builder region maintains clean VM images for its builders; these are
built using ``glance-simplestreams-sync``, which automatically and
periodically copies standard pre-built images from
``cloud-images.ubuntu.com``, and ``launchpad-buildd-image-modifier``, which
hooks into ``glance-simplestreams-sync`` to produce modified images with
``launchpad-buildd`` installed.
