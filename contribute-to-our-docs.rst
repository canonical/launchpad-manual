Style and language
------------------

Launchpad's documentation is aimed at helping both beginners and experts. As 
such, we try to use appropriate writing for the subject, to use inclusive 
language, and to assume that the reader has as little prior knowledge as 
possible.

The navigation, structure, style, and content of our documentation follows the 
`Diátaxis`_ systematic framework for technical documentation authoring. This 
splits pages into tutorials, how-to guides, reference material, and 
explanatory text.

Some general tips that could help to ensure high quality documentation:

- use a spell checker
- resist being overly formal
- resist being overly verbose
- verify links and examples 

We recommend using the `Ubuntu style guide`_.

Feel free to suggest changes to any documentation topic with updated or more 
insightful information. We aim for consistency, but don't let formality 
prevent you from contributing. If something is inconsistent, we'll fix it. 
We'd rather have documentation that we can fix than not have documentation at 
all.

Open Documentation Academy
--------------------------
Launchpad is a proud member of the Canonical Open Documentation Academy (CODA)

The Open Documentation Academy is an initiative that aims to encourage open 
source contributions from the community by making documentation the gateway, 
thus lowering the barrier to entry. 

Through the academy, community members get access to curated and well-defined 
beginner-friendly tasks along with mentorship and advice in a friendly and 
encouraging environment. This allows them to make meaningful contributions to
established open-source projects such as Launchpad from the start.

For experts, the academy can also be a great place to share knowledge and get
involved with new developments. 

For more information on how you can get involved, visit the `CODA website`_. 
You can also browse through the types of issues you'll be working on in the `CODA repository`_. 

Other channels to get invovled with the academy include:

- Our `discussion forum`_ on the Ubuntu Community Hub
- The `Matrix channel`_ for interactive chat

You can also `follow us on Fosstodon`_ for the latest updates and information 
on upcoming events.
