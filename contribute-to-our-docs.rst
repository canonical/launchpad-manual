Style and language
++++++++++++++++++

Launchpad's documentation is aimed at helping both beginners and experts. As 
such, we try to use appropriate writing for the subject, to use inclusive 
language, and to assume that the reader has as little prior knowledge as 
possible.

The navigation, structure, style, and content of our documentation follows the 
`Diátaxis`_ systematic framework for technical documentation authoring. This 
splits pages into tutorials, how-to guides, reference material, and 
explanatory text.

Some general tips that could help to ensure high quality documentation:

- use a spell checker
- resist being overly formal
- resist being overly verbose
- verify links and examples 

We recommend using the `Ubuntu style guide`_.

Feel free to suggest changes to any documentation topic with updated or more 
insightful information. We aim for consistency, but don't let formality 
prevent you from contributing. If something is inconsistent, we'll fix it. 
We'd rather have documentation that we can fix than not have documentation at 
all.
