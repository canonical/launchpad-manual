# Client-side page redirects
# ---------------------------
# Comments start with a single hash (#)
# Each redirect appears on its own line in the format:
#
# redirect/from/ redirect/to/
#
# Paths are relative to the root of the `docs` directory
# The "from" path must be a file that *does not* exist
# The "to" path must be a file that *does* exist
# The separator between "from" and "to" paths is a single space (not a tab)
