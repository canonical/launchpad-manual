Close your account
==================

If you no longer want or need your Launchpad account, you can deactivate it.


.. warning::
  Deactivating your account will remove your Launchpad profile and permanently
  delete all of your:

  * Bug and blueprint subscriptions: assignments will be set to "None".
  * Team memberships: ownership of teams, projects and project groups will be
    reassigned to the Registry Administrators team.
  * Ubuntu Code of Conduct signatures.
  * Assignments as bug contact for a package.
  * Assignments as an answer contact for a project or distribution.

  You will still be credited for any work that you have done that is recorded
  in Launchpad. For example, if you reported a bug, you will still be shown as
  its reporter. You will however not receive any mail regarding it.

Alternatives to deactivating your account
-----------------------------------------

If you want to keep your Launchpad account but would prefer to reduce the
amount of email you receive, try removing your bug and blueprint subscriptions.

* `View your bug subscriptions <https://bugs.launchpad.net/~/+subscribedbugs>`_.
* `View your blueprint subscriptions <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/~/+specs?role=subscriber>`_.

If you want to reduce the amount of information about you in Launchpad, you can `edit your personal details <https://launchpad.net/~/+edit>`_.

Deactivating your account
-------------------------

1. Visit `your Launchpad profile <https://launchpad.net/~>`_.
2. Click ``Change details``. If you wish to ensure that your name is not displayed
   on links to your account after deactivation, then edit your personal details
   here before continuing.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click ``Deactivate your account``.
4. Optionally enter a description of why you are deactivating your Launchpad
   account.
5. If you are certain that you want to permanently delete your subscriptions
   and other information associated with your Launchpad account, click the
   ``Deactivate my account`` button.

Launchpad will now deactivate your account.

Recovering your account
-----------------------

If you later decide that you want to start using Launchpad again, you can
recover your account by logging into Launchpad using the same email address.

.. note::
  Recovering an account will not restore any information that was deleted when you deactivated it.

If you also deleted your account on the login service after
deactivating your Launchpad account, then you will need to :ref:`create a new
account <create-and-personalise-your-launchpad-account>` using one of the email
addresses from your deactivated account, at which point you will get an error
ID due to the account conflict.

Send an email to feedback@launchpad.net explaining the situation and including
the error ID, and we can restore your old account for you.
