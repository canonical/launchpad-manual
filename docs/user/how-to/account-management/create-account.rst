Create and personalise your Launchpad account
=============================================

To create a new Launchpad account, visit the
`account sign-up <https://launchpad.net/+login>`_ page. All you need is an
email address that Launchpad can use to contact you.

A few things to note:

* Confirmation email: If you don't receive a confirmation email from Launchpad
  it may have been incorrectly trapped by a spam filter. If you think this has
  happened, try registering using a `Gmail <http://mail.google.com/>`_ address.
  You can always change your registered email address later on. If that still
  doesn't work, :ref:`let us know <get-help>`.
* Display name: Launchpad will ask you for a display name. This is the name
  people will see on your profile page and next to work that you do. Many
  people choose to use their real name or a widely recognised pseudonym here.
* Protecting your email address: Your email address is hidden from Launchpad
  users, search engine spiders, and spam bots. However, you can make
  your email address visible to registered Launchpad users in your
  `personal details settings <https://launchpad.net/~/+edit>`_.

If you get an error that your email address is already in use, see
:ref:`your-email-address-is-already-in-launchpad`.

Once you've created your account, it's time to tell other Launchpad users a
bit about yourself.

Personalise your profile
------------------------

When you first create your account, your profile looks pretty bare. You can
add information about yourself straight away. Once you start to use Launchpad,
your profile will also automatically tell people about the sort of work you do
in Launchpad.

You can personalise your profile in a few different ways:

* `Add a description <https://launchpad.net/~/+edit>`_ to your profile
* `Register additional email addresses <https://launchpad.net/~/+editemails>`_
* Publish your `IRC nicknames <https://launchpad.net/~/+editircnicknames>`_,
  `Jabber identities <https://launchpad.net/~/+editjabberids>`_,
  `Matrix accounts <https://launchpad.net/~/+editmatrixaccounts>`_,
  and `GitHub accounts <https://launchpad.net/~/+editgithubaccounts>`_.
* Tell Launchpad `your timezone <https://launchpad.net/~/+editlocation>`_.

One of the easiest ways to stamp your mark on Launchpad is to
`upload a profile picture <https://launchpad.net/~/+edit>`_. It should be
192x192 pixels (px) and no more than 100 KB.

Your Launchpad name
-------------------

Your full name will be visible to other Launchpad users next to work you do,
and your username will be mostly used in URLs. If you're an Ubuntu member,
it also forms part of your Ubuntu.com email address in the format
username@ubuntu.com.

For example, if your Launchpad username was ``username``, your Launchpad home
page would be ``https://launchpad.net/~username``, and your Ubuntu email
address ``username@ubuntu.com``.

If you're unhappy with your username, you can
`change it <https://launchpad.net/~/+edit>`_. Changing it once
you've started using Launchpad in full may be awkward as it will also change
the URLs of some of your work.
