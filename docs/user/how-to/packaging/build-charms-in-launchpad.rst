Build Charms in Launchpad
=========================

Charms are software operators for cloud operations which use the Juju
orchestration engine. They can be deployed, integrated, scaled, and configured
on any Kubernetes cluster. Visit the `Charmcraft <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/charmcraft/stable/>`_ 
and `Juju <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/charm/#charm>`_ 
documentation to learn more about charms.

Building charms on Launchpad ensures you get clean builds for multiple 
architectures, including RISC-V 64, without having to manage any local
infrastructure. You also get the option of publishing builds directly to the 
`store <https://charmhub.io/>`_.  

This guide will take you through the process of building charms on Launchpad
through the web interface.
