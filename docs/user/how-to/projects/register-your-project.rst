Register your project
=====================

.. include:: /includes/important_not_revised_help.rst

Registering your project in Launchpad takes just a few minutes and
allows you to use Launchpad to do all or any of the following:

-  track your project's bugs
-  translate your project's user interface
-  host git branches of your project's code
-  import git repositories of your project's code
-  plan and manage the development of features for your project
-  offer an easy way for your project's users to post and answer support
   questions.

{i} **Quick tip:** If you want to register a translation or Ubuntu loco
team in Launchpad, please create a new team, not a project.

**Step 1:** Log in to Launchpad and visit https://launchpad.net/projects/

**Step 2:** Click ``Register a project`` in the left-hand
``Actions`` menu.

**Step 3:** Complete the \```Name```, ``Display Name`` and
``Title`` fields.

Launchpad uses these three different names for your project in different
contexts:

-  **Name:** This is the short name that Launchpad will use for your
   project in URLs. For example: "blueprint" in
   ``https://launchpad.net/blueprint`` for Launchpad's Blueprint
   Tracker.
-  **Display name:** This is the name Launchpad uses for your project in
   the breadcrumb at the top of the screen. For example: "Blueprint".
-  **Title:** This is the long form of your project's name and is the
   most common name that Launchpad uses for your project. For example:
   "The Blueprint Feature Tracker".

**Step 4:** Your project summary and description are used on your
project's homepage. A portion of the summary is also shown in search
results.

In this screen-shot of the Blueprint Tracker's project page, the summary
is highlighted with a red line and the description with a blue line.

**Step 5:** If your project is part of a wider project group, you can
tell Launchpad by entering the project group's name in the ``Part of`` text-box. If you're not sure of the project group's exact
Launchpad name, click ``Choose...`` to search for it.

For example: Blueprint is part of the launchpad-project group.

If you make this project part of a project group, the group preferences
and decisions around bug tracking, translation and security policy will
also apply to this project.

{i} **Note:** You can request a new project group by emailing
feedback@launchpad.net. Describe your project, its constituent parts and
why a project group is the best way to organise them. Launchpad team
administrators will reply to let you know if your request has been
successful.

**Step 6:** The following fields allow you to tell Launchpad users more
about your project and are not used by Launchpad itself.

{i} **Quick tip:** Once you've registered your project, you can use
Launchpad to host your project's downloadable files. Find out more about
:ref:`file downloads <making-your-project-files-available-for-download>`.

**Step 7:** When you're ready, click the ``Add`` button to create
your project in Launchpad. Launchpad will now take you straight to your
new project page.
