Your Launchpad account
======================

.. include:: /includes/important_not_revised_help.rst

Before you start using Launchpad, you need to :ref:`set up a Launchpad
account <create-and-personalise-your-launchpad-account>`. With your new Launchpad account,
you'll be able to:

-  show other people what work you do in Launchpad and earn karma
-  join teams working on free software
-  file, comment on, triage and solve bugs
-  host and monitor code in git repositories
-  help translate software
-  contribute ideas and specifications to free software projects, then
   track their progress
-  ask for and offer help with free software
-  build and host Ubuntu packages
-  register your own project and make its binaries available for
   download.

Of course, you can pick and choose which parts of Launchpad interest
you.

Managing your account
---------------------

Here are some of the things you might want to do when you first join
Launchpad:

-  :ref:`create-and-personalise-your-launchpad-account`
-  :ref:`import-an-openpgp-key`
-  :ref:`import-your-ssh-keys`
-  :ref:`Learn about Launchpad karma <your-account-karma>`
-  :ref:`Log into other websites using OpenID through
   Launchpad <log-into-websites-with-openid>`
-  :ref:`collaborating-with-other-launchpad-users`

If you have more than one account, you may want to :ref:`merge them <merging-accounts>`.

And we'd hate to see you leave but, if you need to, you can also :ref:`close
your account <how-to-close-account>`.
