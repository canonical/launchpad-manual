Indirect team members
=====================

.. include:: /includes/important_not_revised_help.rst

Teams can be members of other teams.

If Team A joins Team B, all of Team A's members become indirect members
of Team B.

Even though they're called "indirect members" they still get to do all
the same things as people who have signed up for that team directly.
