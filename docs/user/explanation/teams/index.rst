Launchpad teams
===============

.. include:: /includes/important_not_revised_help.rst

Launchpad teams are a great way for people to organise themselves around
a particular community or effort.

In Launchpad, teams are very similar to people: you can assign a bug to
a team, place a team in a bug contact role, run a team code branch,
publish Ubuntu packages in a team archive and teams can even join other
teams.

When you join one, you automatically can access everything the team has
access to.
