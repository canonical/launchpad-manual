Launchpad feature highlights
============================

Welcome to Launchpad, the platform designed to help you share your software 
projects with the world. You can use this platform to host your code, but 
you'll also have access to features that help you collaborate with others, 
track bugs, manage project releases and more. 

Get familiar with some of Launchpad's most exciting features below.

:ref:`The answer tracker <answer-tracker-for-community>`
--------------------------------------------------------
This feature makes it convenient to get support from the community. It offers a
framework for capturing discussions on different questions and issues for each 
registered project and turning them into a knowledge-base. 

Community members can sign up to become answer contacts for a project, allowing
them to be notified when questions are asked.

:ref:`Blueprints <blueprints-lightweight-specifications>`
---------------------------------------------------------
A blueprint is a placeholder for work. It's a declaration of a desire to work 
on something or see something worked on. They can be contributed by anyone and 
can be proposals for:

- Bug fixes
- Documenation
- Implementation of ideas, etc.

Project leaders determine which blueprints should be implemented and when.

:ref:`Personal package archives <personal-package-archives-highlights>`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A personal package archive allows you to publish software packages that can be
installed on an Ubuntu system. You can create and distribute your own PPA by 
creating a source package, getting it built on Launchpad, and publishing it.


:ref:`Bug watches <monitoring-bugs-in-other-bug-trackers>`
----------------------------------------------------------
Launchpad allows you to track the status of bugs reported in other communities,
allowing you to conveniently keep track of bugs relating to your project
regardless of where they are reported. 

Once you provide the bug report's URL, Launchpad will regularly check the 
status of the external bug tracker automatically.

:ref:`Milestones <milestones-exp>`
----------------------------------
You can use milestones to indicate the bugs and blueprints you are prioritizing
for a specific release or within a given period. Although Launchpad provides 
features that enable stricter project management, e.g., product series, 
milestones offer a less restrictive approach that makes sense for small 
projects. 

Additional features
-------------------
There are other features you can try out on Launchpad to aid your software 
collaborations including:

- The :ref:`email interface <launchpad-email-interface>`: Interact with the bug tracker without going to your browser
- :ref:`Bug branch linking <linking-bugs-to-dedicated-branches>`: Link a branch fixing a specific bug to the bug report
- :ref:`Product series <series-major-stable-and-development-branches>`: Register different project series, and separate stable, development, and obsolete branches
- :ref:`Bug tracker <the-launchpad-bug-tracker>`: Launchpad's bug tracking tool which makes every bug available to every project and distribution
