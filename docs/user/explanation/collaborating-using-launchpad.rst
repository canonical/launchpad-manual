Collaborating with other Launchpad users
========================================
.. include:: /includes/important_not_revised_help.rst


Launchpad is a social website: it's all about collaboration. That's why your profile page includes details of how to contact you, along with an option to contact you using a web form.

Protecting you from email address harvesters
--------------------------------------------

When your email address appears in Launchpad, it is only visible to people who are logged into Launchpad. Anonymous users - including spam bots, search engine spiders, etc - do not see your email address.

Contacting individuals via their profile page
---------------------------------------------

If you'd prefer that other Launchpad users don't know your email address, you can `choose to hide it <https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+editemails>`_.

However, that makes it harder for you to make the most of Launchpad. For example: if you apply to join a team, sometimes the team administrator might want to contact you before approving your application.

As a compromise, `your Launchpad profile page <https://launchpad.net/people/+me>`_ has a *Contact this user* option. That lets other logged-in Launchpad users send you an email without knowing your email address.

When someone contacts you in this way they can:


* send no more than three emails that way each day, whether they're to the same or three different recipients
* choose which of their confirmed email addresses the message comes from.

.. note::
    If you reply, you'll reveal your email address as it then becomes a normal email conversation.

Contacting teams via their overview page
----------------------------------------

You can also send a message to a team's contact address or all the team members if the team has no contact address. Just look on the team's overview page for a *Contact this team* link.

Filtering email from the contact form
-------------------------------------

All email sent using Launchpad's contact form has the following header:

X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale: ContactViaWeb
