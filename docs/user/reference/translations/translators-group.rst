Launchpad translators group
===========================

.. include:: /includes/important_not_revised_help.rst

The `Launchpad Translators group <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators/>`__ is a set of teams and individuals working on translating software hosted in Launchpad. It is a confederation of translation teams, it is not yet another translation project.

We believe that people translating software in the same language should
work in the same team, even thought they are working at different
software.

There is one Launchpad localization team appointed for each language.

We encourage Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, GNOME, KDE, Mozilla,
OpenOffice.org and all other translators dedicated to a specific
project to join the localization team appointed for their language.

We also encourage project maintainers to appoint the **Launchpad
Translators** group as the translation group for their project.

Project maintainers
-------------------

Every project needs high quality translation that convey with the
cultural background and the already established guidelines of each
language.

The **Launchpad Translators** group stands for those goals. Here you can
find a list of steps to follow in order to use Launchpad Translations as
the translation tool for you project and have it translated into many
languages.

-  Before proceeding, please take a moment and see how you can use Launchpad and what you should do in order to have your project translated. You can find these information at :ref:`Translating your project help pages <translating-your-project>`.

-  Choose a translation permissions policy and appoint the "Launchpad Translators" group for doing the translation. Follow this link to find more info about :ref:`Choosing permissions policy <choosing-a-permissions-policy>`. We recommend using the *Structured* policy, as a measure to assure translation quality.

-  The direct link to your project permissions policy is:
   https://translations.launchpad.net/%3CYOUR-PROJECT-NAME%3E/+settings.

-  You can contact the `Launchpad Translators Team <https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-translators>`__ for announcing things that affect all languages (ex. approaching release, major string changes, string freeze... etc.) or a `specific language team <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators/>`__ for things affecting only one language.

-  You can also send an initial message to the `Launchpad Translators Team <https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-translators>`__ and let them know about your project.

-  When you are due to release a new version of your project, contact
   the team and let them know when you would like to release: in this
   way translators can better organize their work. It is good to advise
   them at least two weeks before a release.

-  If there are any translations errors or bug in your project please assign them to the `Launchpad Translators team <https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-translators>`__. We will look at the problems and assign them to the proper team or person.

-  For your project Answers section, if people ask about specific translations or localization matters, you can assign those questions to the `Launchpad Translators Team <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators/>`__. We will try to analyze it and have a knowledgable person take care or it.

Translators
-----------

All members of a Launchpad localization teams should be knowledgable in
translating software into their own language, be aware about the work of
other localization teams and about other translation projects.

Below is a list of steps you might follow in order to start using
Launchpad Translations for translating your favorite project or
distributions.

-  Before doing any translation work please take a moment and learn how to use Launchpad as your translation tool. For more information :ref:`check the Launchpad Translations help pages <preparing-to-translate>`.

-  Consult the `list of translations teams <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators/>`__ and check the team assigned to your language. If there is no team assigned for your language, please follow the required step to create a new one. Below you will find more information on how to create a new team.

-  Follow the procedure for joining the team for your language. Before
   joining a team you might be asked to do some translation in order to
   test your translation skills.

-  Follow the rules of your team, communicate and keep in touch with the
   team.

Launchpad localization teams
----------------------------

Launchpad localization teams are the driving force behind the Launchpad
translation process. Each localization team will translate and check
translations on behalf of the language appointed to it.

Launchpad Translators Group will only have one team appointed to each
language.

To check the current status of Launchpad Translators Group, please consult the `list of Launchpad localization teams <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators/>`__:

-  If your language does not appear in the list, please consider
   starting a new team for your language.
-  If your language is in the list, please consider joining that team
   (or request that your current team to be added as a subteam).

If the Launchpad localization team appointed to your language is no longer active, or in case you encounter problems joining or working with the team, please let us know by contacting the `Launchpad Translation Coordinators <https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-translations-coordinators>`__.

How to start a new team and join Launchpad Translators
------------------------------------------------------

Here's how you can create a new team for your language and join the
Launchpad Translators group:

-  **Create the team**. `Create a new Launchpad localization team <https://launchpad.net/people/+newteam>`__. When giving a name to the team in Launchpad, please follow the convention **lp-l10n-CC**, where CC is your **language** code . We use iso-639 two letters code and if not available we fallback to three letters code. For instance **lp-l10n-de** would be the name for the German team (language code *de*)
-  **Moderated subscription**. Make the :ref:`subscription policy <membership-policies>` of the new team **Moderated** or **Restricted**. Only this way you can ensure the quality of translations.
-  **Team information**. Add some brief information on the team's page.
   This should include:

   -  A welcome note with the purpose of the team
   -  A note on how to join the team
   -  Links to the team's existing communication channels (e.g. mailing
      list, forums, IRC channel, wiki, etc)

-  **Team communication**. The team should have a communication channel
   to coordinate the translation activities. This can be any of: a
   mailing list, IRC, forums, etc. This can be arranged after the team
   has been accepted, but it is a requirement.
-  **Guidelines**. The team should have a set of translation guidelines.
   This can be arranged after the team has been accepted, but it is a
   requirement.

   -  You can use the :ref:`general Launchpad localization guidelines <translating-your-software>` or adapt them for your language/team.
   -  :ref:`Let Launchpad know about your translation guidelines <translation-guidelines>`.

-  **Coordinator**. The team should have a coordinator with a stable
   contact e-mail address visible to logged-in Launchpad users. The
   coordinator should forward any relevant announcements or information to the
   team. As the coordinator, you are the primary contact person for the
   team and the person who make things happen.

   -  As the coordinator of a Launchpad localization team, it is higly recommended to join the `Launchpad Translators team <https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-translators>`__.

-  **Apply**. `Send a support request <https://answers.launchpad.net/rosetta/+addquestion>`__ for the Launchpad Translations Coordinators to appoint your team in the Launchpad Translators group. Please include a link to your team and a short note explaining how you have addressed the points above.

Except for creating the guidelines and setting up a communication channel, this process should not take more than a few minutes to complete. If you need any help or you've got any questions in any of the steps, feel free to `ask <https://answers.launchpad.net/rosetta/+addquestion>`__, and we'll be happy to give a hand.
