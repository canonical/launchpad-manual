Launchpad Teams
===============

.. include:: /includes/important_not_revised_help.rst

There are more than 2,000 teams registered in Launchpad, covering
activities as diverse as `translating Ubuntu into
Esperanto <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-eo>`__ and `Zope 3
development <https://launchpad.net/~zope3-dev>`__, to simple groups such
as `Ubuntu Users <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-users>`__ and `Ubuntu
LoCo Enthusiasts <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-loco-enthusiasts>`__.

Joining a team puts you in contact with others working towards a similar
goal and gives you access to shared team resources. All you need to join
most teams is an interest in the work they do.

Learning more about a team
--------------------------

When joining a team, you will see right away what the team is all about, e.g. a local 
team for Ubuntu fans in Colorado.

There's also a summary of the team's membership and contact details.

Membership policies
-------------------

The Ubuntu Colorado team has an open membership policy but that's just
one of three policies its creator could have chosen:

-  **Open:** anyone can join.
-  **Moderated:** a team administrator must approve membership
   applications.
-  **Restricted:** you can't apply to join, only the team's
   administrators can add new members.

If a team is open or moderated, you can sign up using the ``Join the
team`` link in the *Membership* section. When you apply to join,
Launchpad will email you and the team's administrators.

If it is a moderated team, you'll also receive a second email once the
administrators have chosen to accept or decline your application.

Viewing a team's members
------------------------

You can take a look at who has already joined a team by viewing its
membership list. This can be useful if you need to contact one of the
team's administrators.

Finding a team
--------------

You can `search teams <https://launchpad.net/people>`__ by their names
or contact addresses in Launchpad.

.. tip::
    If you already know the team's name, you can visit it
    directly. For example: https://launchpad.net/~5-a-day

Further information
-------------------

If there isn't yet a team in Launchpad that deals with the activity or
community that interests you, you can :ref:`create your own team <creating-and-running-launchpad-teams>`.
