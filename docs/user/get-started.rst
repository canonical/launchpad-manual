Get started with Launchpad
==========================

.. include:: /includes/important_not_revised_help.rst

Welcome to Launchpad! If you're here because you've just created your Launchpad account, here are some suggestions for what you might want to do next:

* `Edit your Launchpad profile page <https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+edit>`_ -- add a photo, tell the world about yourself
* `Find projects to work with <https://launchpad.net/projects>`_

What you can do with Launchpad
------------------------------

Launchpad is a hosting and collaboration service for software projects. You can use Launchpad to:

* report and learn more about bugs in software you use - :ref:`more about Bugs <the-launchpad-bug-tracker>`
* help translate software - :ref:`more about Translations <translating-with-launchpad>`
* host, share and find code
* ask for help with software - :ref:`more about Answers <launchpad-answer-tracker>`
* plan, assign and follow the progress of chunks of work :ref:`more about Blueprint <blueprints-lightweight-specifications>`
* create and host Ubuntu packages - :ref:`more about Personal Package Archives <ref-personal-package-archives>`

You can also :ref:`register your software project <registering-your-project>` in our directory, then pick and choose which parts of Launchpad you want to use. It's free for :ref:`free software projects <launchpad-policies>` - :ref:`contact us <get-help>` if your project uses a non-free licence.

Want to try Launchpad?
----------------------

Try Launchpad in our `staging environment <https://staging.launchpad.net>`_ without worrying about touching real data. Staging uses a copy of Launchpad's real database and gets wiped at the end of every week.

Before you can use staging, you'll need to :ref:`register your account <create-and-personalise-your-launchpad-account>` in Launchpad's `production environment <https://launchpad.net>`_ and then wait up to one day for your account to be copied over to staging.

.. note::
   Some features aren't automatically active on staging, including:

* translation imports and automatic approval
* translation exports.

If you need to try these features on staging, `ask us <https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad>`_.
