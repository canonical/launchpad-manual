Launchpad user documentation
============================

Launchpad is designed for effective open-source collaboration. It provides the
tools you need to build open-source projects and share them with the 
world.

Launchpad gives you access to everything necessary to build and publish 
software including code hosting, issue tracking, and request tracking for bugs. 
Features unique to this platform include build capacities for different 
languages, and package formats for different architectures such as **AMD64**, 
**ARM**, and **RISC-V**.

Launchpad also offers tracking capabilities across issue trackers to 
seamlessly communicate with upstream projects.
