Launchpad user documentation
============================

Launchpad is designed for effective open-source collaboration. It offers
users the tools they need to build their open-source projects and share them 
with the world.

Users get access to everything necessary to build and publish software 
including code hosting, issue tracking, and request tracking for bugs and 
features. Unique features include build capacities for different languages, and 
package formats for different architectures such as AMD64, ARM, and RISC-V.

Launchpad also offers tracking capabilities across issue trackers to 
seamlessly communicate with upstream projects.
