Fetch service
=============

Short description
-----------------
A proxy that can be used by Launchpad builders as an alternative to the squid
proxy. When used, it keeps track of requests and dependencies for the build.

Detailed description
--------------------
The fetch service is a proxy service used by Launchpad builders (see
:doc:`Build Farm <build-farm>`) that keeps track of dependencies downloaded
during a build. This ensures developers have a trustworthy record of all the
parts that make up the software being built.

The service contains a set of APIs endpoints that can be distinguished into
two groups:

* Control endpoints (default port ``9999``): used by Launchpad to manage the
  fetch service sessions

* Proxy endpoints (default port ``9988``): used within the builder to access
  external resources

The life-cycle of a fetch-service session within Launchpad goes as follows:

1. Launchpad (specifically,
   `launchpad-buildd-manager <https://git.launchpad.net/~launchpad/launchpad/tree/charm/launchpad-buildd-manager>`_)
   makes a request to the fetch service control endpoint for the creation of
   a fetch service session, which returns a ``session ID`` and a ``token``.
   Launchpad sends those details to 
   `launchpad buildd <https://git.launchpad.net/~launchpad/launchpad-buildd>`_
   to be used during the build.

2. During a build, any external requests go through the fetch service proxy
   endpoint, using the specific ``session ID`` and ``token``. The fetch
   service keeps track of all requests made during the build to that given
   ``session ID``.

3. After the pull-phase or at the end of the build (depending on the
   configuration of the snap itself within Launchpad), `launchpad-buildd`
   makes a request to the fetch service control endpoint to revoke the
   ``token``, meaning no new external requests can be made during that build.

4. After the end of the build, when Launchpad gathers the resulting artifacts,
   Launchpad makes a request to the fetch service control endpoint to gather
   the metadata from the session (i.e., a file that contains all the requests
   and dependencies fetched during the build) for the specified ``session ID``.

5. Launchpad makes a final request to the fetch service control endpoint to
   end session ``session ID``, which deletes all data for that session that
   was stored in the fetch service database.

Using the fetch service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, the fetch service can only be used for building snaps, charms, rocks 
and sourcecraft packages.

For `Snaps` and `Charms`, this option is now available in the `Edit recipe` UI.
For all recipe types, the ``use_fetch_service`` flag can be set to ``true`` in
the API.

The fetch service can be run in two modes, "strict" and "permissive", where it
defaults to the former. The "strict" mode only allows certain resources and
formats, and errors out in any case the restrictions are violated. The
"permissive" mode works similar, but only logs a warning when encountering any
violations.

The mode can be configured using the ``fetch_service_policy`` option via API,
with the currently two possible values ``permissive`` and ``strict``. For
`Snaps`, the mode can also be selected from a dropdown on the `Edit recipe`
page.

Requests to use the fetch service shall be made to the Launchpad team through
the usual channels (by
`opening a question <https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad>`_, or emailing
the team at feedback@launchpad.net).

Fetch service maintainers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The fetch service code itself is not maintained by Launchpad - it is
maintained by Canonical's Starcraft team. Nonetheless, the service was created
to be used by Launchpad builders, and that's currently its purpose.

Launchpad maintains its mojo specs and deployment to its environments.

Deployment
----------
We deploy the fetch service using the specs defined in
`fetch service mojo specs <https://git.launchpad.net/~launchpad/launchpad-mojo-specs/+git/private/tree/lp-fetch-service/bundle.yaml>`_.

In order to be able to evaluate new fetch service versions, we use different
Snap channels and revisions for qastaging and production, so we are able to
test new releases. This information is both defined in above mentioned mojo
specs, and in `ST118 fetch service release process <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HZvFo78LqFGgdpM7v3teG9gV-pMyvXpXTD1vcLLv_d0/>`_.

The fetch service uses various inspectors: we have the inspector for ``git``, ``craft`` builds
and other will be released in future. 
The inspector is responsible for inspecting the requests and the various
downloads that are made during the build. The inspector is also responsible
for making sure that the requests are allowed to be made.
Every inspector is fully configurable and the ``allowlist`` is specified in the configuration
file.
This configuration is managed by the aforementioned mojo specs.

Configuration example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   git:
     urls:
       - https://test.com/**

   crafts:
     urls:
      - https://test.com/**

   snap:
     snap-declaration:
       - name: publisher-id
         value: [canonical]

   apt:
     repositories:
       default:
         urls:
           - http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
         dists:
           - "*"
         components:
           - "*"


Moreover, the fetch service snap require certificates to work properly.
This is something that the snap can create when it's installed: the snap will 
call the related hook available `here <https://github.com/canonical/fetch-service/blob/49f7382262da4aa71d931130524315c07f4be28d/snap/hooks/install#L20>`_.

These certificates are also configurable from the charm itself if we have the need to
change them, using the following command:

``juju config fetch-service proxy.certificate="$(cat certs/ca.pem)" proxy.key="$(cat certs/ca.key.pem)"``

.. note::

   If you want to create them, you can follow the process described in the install hook:
   `certificate creation <https://github.com/canonical/fetch-service/blob/49f7382262da4aa71d931130524315c07f4be28d/snap/hooks/install#L20>`_.

The certificates are stored in the ``${SNAP_DATA}/certs`` directory inside the fetch-service
charm unit.

In order to configure properly our builders and the ``launchpad-buildd-manager`` we should 
pass the ``base64`` encoded ``ca.pem`` certificate to the ``launchpad-buildd-manager`` charm 
using the following command, making sure that is passed as a one-line value:

``juju config launchpad-buildd-manager fetch_service_mitm_certificate=<encoded-one-line-value>``

Alternatively, to access the fetch-service internal logs, one needs to:

1. SSH into Launchpad's bastion and switch to the following user: 
   ``stg-lp-fetch-service-qastaging@launchpad-bastion-ps5``.

2. SSH into the fetch-service juju unit by running
   ``juju ssh fetch-service/leader``.

3. Run ``sudo snap logs fetch-service -n 100 -f`` (where ``-n`` sets the number
   of log lines, and ``-f`` keeps up the latest logs up-to-date).

You can also check the logs in the following directory:
``/var/snap/fetch-service/current``.

Monitoring
----------
Not set up.

Common support cases
--------------------
The fetch service is not currently widely used. As such, there haven't been a
lot of support requests made.

More information

None.
