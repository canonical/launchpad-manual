Fixing Bugs
===========

.. include:: ../../includes/important_not_revised.rst

So you want to fix a bug?
-------------------------

If you want to fix a bug in Launchpad, many people are here to help you!

Assuming you already know the bug you want to fix, then proceed to the
**Discuss It** section below.

If you don't know which bug you you want to fix, please take a look at the list
of `open bugs marked as 'trivial'`_.

.. _open bugs marked as 'trivial': https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_supervisor=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.has_patch.used=&field.has_cve.used=&field.tag=trivial&field.tags_combinator=ANY&search=Search|open bugs marked as 'trivial'

You can also try a non-trivial bug, of course, but the trivial ones are
probably the best place to start.

Discuss It
----------

Don't just start hacking away. First, discuss the bug and your proposed fix in
one of our :ref:`channels <get-help>`.

Once you have a plan of attack, please mention in the bug that you've started
on it, that is mark it as "In Progress" and describe your plan there.

In general, err on the side of overcommunication rather than
undercommunication. If you have a question, ask it.
It's much better to ask than to spend hours going down the wrong route, only to
find out later.

Making a Patch
--------------

Once you're ready to develop a patch, please see XXX [[Patches]] for how to
maintain the patch branch in Launchpad, and how to get it reviewed and merged.
